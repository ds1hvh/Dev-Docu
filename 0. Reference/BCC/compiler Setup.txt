=================

BCC is provided as a bzipped tar-file. It should be unpacked in the /opt directory of the host:
mkdir /opt

tar -C /opt -xjf sparc-elf-<version-number>.tar.bz2

After installation, add /opt/sparc-elf-<gcc-version-number>/bin to the PATH variable. This should
be done by adding the following line to the file .profile in the home directory:

export PATH=/opt/sparc-elf-<gcc-version-number>/bin:$PATH

source .profile
